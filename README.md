# SHA 256 cpp implementation

Test implementation of sha256 based on the [NIST white paper](docs/nist.pdf).


#### Future
* Add command line sha256 checksum for files and text input.
* Organize code into proper directories (use a src folder).
* FIX: Broken cases for non-byte sized inputs depnding on sizes
